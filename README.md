# Landing Page Project
A project to apply CSS and HTML concepts learnt in **The Odin Project** (TOP).

Note that this project is not meant to be displayed in a phone screen, as that still scapes my CSS knowledge. To see the landing page well proportioned use a desktop computer.

This project was made from zero, using only the image below as guide. You can compare it with my page, and see that are some minor differences as the Font Style used. But I tried to get as close as I could.
